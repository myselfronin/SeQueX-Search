        "abstract": "Although  Recommender Systems  have been comprehensively analyzed in the past decade, the study of social-based recommender systems just started. In this paper, aiming at providing a general method for improving recommender systems by incorporating social network information, we propose a matrix factorization framework with social regularization. The contributions of this paper are four-fold: (1) We elaborate how social network information can benefit recommender systems; (2) We interpret the differences between social-based recommender systems and trust-aware recommender systems; (3) We coin the term  Social Regularization  to represent the social constraints on recommender systems, and we systematically illustrate how to design a matrix factorization objective function with social regularization; and (4) The proposed method is quite general, which can be easily extended to incorporate other contextual information, like social tags, etc. The empirical analysis on two large datasets demonstrates that our approaches outperform other state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "The success of the Semantic Web depends on the availability of Web pages annotated with metadata. Free form metadata or tags, as used in social bookmarking and folksonomies, have become more and more popular and successful. Such tags are relevant keywords associated with or assigned to a piece of information (e.g., a Web page), describing the item and enabling keyword-based classification. In this paper we propose P-TAG, a method which automatically generates personalized tags for Web pages. Upon browsing a Web page, P-TAG produces keywords relevant both to its textual content, but also to the data residing on the surfer's Desktop, thus expressing a personalized viewpoint. Empirical evaluations with several algorithms pursuing this approach showed very promising results. We are therefore very confident that such a user oriented automatic tagging approach can provide large scale personalized metadata annotations as an important step towards realizing the Semantic Web.",

        "abstract": "As an increasing amount of RDF data is published as Linked Data, intuitive ways of accessing this data become more and more important. Question answering approaches have been proposed as a good compromise between intuitiveness and expressivity. Most question answering systems translate questions into triples which are matched against the RDF data to retrieve an answer, typically relying on some similarity metric. However, in many cases, triples do not represent a faithful representation of the semantic structure of the natural language question, with the result that more expressive queries can not be answered. To circumvent this problem, we present a novel approach that relies on a parse of the question to produce a SPARQL template that directly mirrors the internal structure of the question. This template is then instantiated using statistical entity identification and predicate detection. We show that this approach is competitive and discuss cases of questions that can be answered with our approach but not with competing approaches.",

        "title": "Fuzzy Keyword Search over Encrypted Data in Cloud Computing",
        "abstract": "As Cloud Computing becomes prevalent, more and more sensitive information are being centralized into the cloud. For the protection of data privacy, sensitive data usually have to be encrypted before outsourcing, which makes effective data utilization a very challenging task. Although traditional searchable encryption schemes allow a user to securely search over encrypted data through keywords and selectively retrieve files of interest, these techniques support only exact keyword search. That is, there is no tolerance of minor typos and format inconsistencies which, on the other hand, are typical user searching behavior and happen very frequently. This significant drawback makes existing techniques unsuitable in Cloud Computing as it greatly affects system usability, rendering user searching experiences very frustrating and system efficacy very low. In this paper, for the first time we formalize and solve the problem of effective fuzzy keyword search over encrypted cloud data while maintaining keyword privacy. Fuzzy keyword search greatly enhances system usability by returning the matching files when users' searching inputs exactly match the predefined keywords or the closest possible matching files based on keyword similarity semantics, when exact match fails. In our solution, we exploit edit distance to quantify keywords similarity and develop an advanced technique on constructing fuzzy keyword sets, which greatly reduces the storage and representation overheads. Through rigorous security analysis, we show that our proposed solution is secure and privacy-preserving, while correctly realizing the goal of fuzzy keyword search.",

        "abstract": "As the data and ontology layers of the Semantic Web stack have achieved a certain level of maturity in standard recommendations such as RDF and OWL, the current focus lies on two related aspects. On the one hand, the definition of a suitable query language for RDF, SPARQL, is close to recommendation status within the W3C. The establishment of the rules layer on top of the existing stack on the other hand marks the next step to be taken, where languages with their roots in Logic Programming and Deductive Databases are receiving considerable attention. The purpose of this paper is threefold. First, we discuss the formal semantics of SPARQLextending recent results in several ways. Second, weprovide translations from SPARQL to Datalog with negation as failure. Third, we propose some useful and easy to implement extensions of SPARQL, based on this translation. As it turns out, the combination serves for direct implementations of SPARQL on top of existing rules engines as well as a basis for more general rules and query languages on top of RDF.",

        "abstract": "The supremacy of  n -gram models in statistical language modelling has recently been challenged by parametric models that use distributed representations to counteract the difficulties caused by data sparsity. We propose three new probabilistic language models that define the distribution of the next word in a sequence given several preceding words by using distributed representations of those words. We show how real-valued distributed representations for words can be learned at the same time as learning a large set of stochastic binary hidden features that are used to predict the distributed representation of the next word from previous distributed representations. Adding connections from the previous states of the binary hidden features improves performance as does adding direct connections between the real-valued distributed representations. One of our models significantly outperforms the very best  n -gram models.",

        "title": "User interactions in social networks and their implications",
        "abstract": "Social networks are popular platforms for interaction, communication and collaboration between friends. Researchers have recently proposed an emerging class of applications that leverage relationships from social networks to improve security and performance in applications such as email, web browsing and overlay routing. While these applications often cite social network connectivity statistics to support their designs, researchers in psychology and sociology have repeatedly cast doubt on the practice of inferring meaningful relationships from social network connections alone.   This leads to the question: Are social links valid indicators of real user interaction? If not, then how can we quantify these factors to form a more accurate model for evaluating socially-enhanced applications? In this paper, we address this question through a detailed study of user interactions in the Facebook social network. We propose the use of interaction graphs to impart meaning to online social links by quantifying user interactions. We analyze interaction graphs derived from Facebook user traces and show that they exhibit significantly lower levels of the \"small-world\" properties shown in their social graph counterparts. This means that these graphs have fewer \"supernodes\" with extremely high degree, and overall network diameter increases significantly as a result. To quantify the impact of our observations, we use both types of graphs to validate two well-known social-based applications (RE and SybilGuard). The results reveal new insights into both systems, and confirm our hypothesis that studies of social applications should use real indicators of user interactions in lieu of social graphs.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach for automatically generating image descriptions: visual detectors, language models, and multimodal similarity models learnt directly from a dataset of image captions. We use multiple instance learning to train visual detectors for words that commonly occur in captions, including many different parts of speech such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives. The word detector outputs serve as conditional inputs to a maximum-entropy language model. The language model learns from a set of over 400,000 image descriptions to capture the statistics of word usage. We capture global semantics by re-ranking caption candidates using sentence-level features and a deep multimodal similarity model. Our system is state-of-the-art on the official Microsoft COCO benchmark, producing a BLEU-4 score of 29.1%. When human judges compare the system captions to ones written by other people on our held-out test set, the system captions have equal or better quality 34% of the time.",

While a substantial amount of research has already been performed in the area of recommender systems, most existing approaches focus on recommending the most relevant items to users without taking into account any ad- ditional contextual information, such as time, location, or the company of other peo- ple (e.g., for watching movies or dining out). In this chapter we argue that relevant contextual information does matter in recommender systems and that it is important to take this information into account when providing recommendations. We discuss the general notion of context and how it can be modeled in recommender systems. Furthermore, we introduce three different algorithmic paradigms - contextual pre- filtering, post-filtering, and modeling - for incorporating contextual information into the recommendation process, discuss the possibilities of combining several context- aware recommendation techniques into a single unifying approach, and provide a case study of one such combined approach. Finally, we present additional capabil- ities for context-aware recommenders and discuss important and promising direc- tions for future research.",

        "abstract": "Speaking using unconstrained natural language is an intuitive and flexible way for humans to interact with robots. Understanding this kind of linguistic input is challenging because diverse words and phrases must be mapped into structures that the robot can understand, and elements in those structures must be grounded in an uncertain environment. We present a system that follows natural language directions by extracting a sequence of  spatial description clauses  from the linguistic input and then infers the most probable path through the environment given only information about the environmental geometry and detected visible objects. We use a probabilistic graphical model that factors into three key components. The first component grounds landmark phrases such as \"the computers\" in the perceptual frame of the robot by exploiting co-occurrence statistics from a database of tagged images such as Flickr. Second, a spatial reasoning component judges how well spatial relations such as \"past the computers\" describe a path. Finally, verb phrases such as \"turn right\" are modeled according to the amount of change in orientation in the path. Our system follows 60% of the directions in our corpus to within 15 meters of the true destination, significantly outperforming other approaches.",

        "abstract": "Most topic models, such as latent Dirichlet allocation, rely on the bag-of-words assumption. However, word order and phrases are often critical to capturing the meaning of text in many text mining tasks. This paper presents topical n-grams, a topic model that discovers topics as well as topical phrases. The probabilistic model generates words in their textual order by, for each word, first sampling a topic, then sampling its status as a unigram or bigram, and then sampling the word from a topic-specific unigram or bigram distribution. Thus our model can model \"white house\" as a special meaning phrase in the 'politics' topic, but not in the 'real estate' topic. Successive bigrams form longer phrases. We present experiments showing meaningful phrases and more interpretable topics from the NIPS data and improved information retrieval performance on a TREC collection.",

In this paper, we move towards this direction and develop an extension of the sequential pattern mining paradigm that analyzes the trajectories of moving objects. We introduce  trajectory patterns  as concise descriptions of frequent behaviours, in terms of both space (i.e., the regions of space visited during movements) and time (i.e., the duration of movements). In this setting, we provide a general formal statement of the novel mining problem and then study several different instantiations of different complexity.

In this paper we show how a class of two-layer undirected graphical models, called Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM's), can be used to model tabular data, such as user's ratings of movies. We present efficient learning and inference procedures for this class of models and demonstrate that RBM's can be successfully applied to the Netflix data set, containing over 100 million user/movie ratings. We also show that RBM's slightly outperform carefully-tuned SVD models. When the predictions of multiple RBM models and multiple SVD models are linearly combined, we achieve an error rate that is well over 6% better than the score of Netflix's own system.",

        "abstract": "Evaluative texts on the Web have become a valuable source of opinions on products, services, events, individuals, etc. Recently, many researchers have studied such opinion sources as product reviews, forum posts, and blogs. However, existing research has been focused on classification and summarization of opinions using natural language processing and data mining techniques. An important issue that has been neglected so far is opinion spam or trustworthiness of online opinions. In this paper, we study this issue in the context of product reviews, which are opinion rich and are widely used by consumers and product manufacturers. In the past two years, several startup companies also appeared which aggregate opinions from product reviews. It is thus high time to study spam in reviews. To the best of our knowledge, there is still no published study on this topic, although Web spam and email spam have been investigated extensively. We will see that opinion spam is quite different from Web spam and email spam, and thus requires different detection techniques. Based on the analysis of 5.8 million reviews and 2.14 million reviewers from amazon.com, we show that opinion spam in reviews is widespread. This paper analyzes such spam activities and presents some novel techniques to detect them",

The potential benefit from this source is made more significant due to the enormous amount of language data easily available today. We present a system to automatically generate natural language descriptions from images that exploits both statistics gleaned from parsing large quantities of text data and recognition algorithms from computer vision. The system is very effective at producing relevant sentences for images. It also generates descriptions that are notably more true to the specific image content than previous work.",

We use the semantics of image labels to integrate prior knowledge about inter-class relationships into the visual appearance learning. We show how to build and train a semantic hierarchy of discriminative classifiers and how to use it to perform object detection. We evaluate how our approach influences the classification accuracy and speed on the Pascal VOC challenge 2006 dataset, a set of challenging real-world images. We also demonstrate additional features that become available to object recognition due to the extension with semantic inference tools- we can classify high-level categories, such as animals, and we can train part detectors, for example a window detector, by pure inference in the semantic network.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present Triplify - a simplistic but effective approach to publish Linked Data from relational databases. Triplify is based on mapping HTTP-URI requests onto relational database queries. Triplify transforms the resulting relations into RDF statements and publishes the data on the Web in various RDF serializations, in particular as Linked Data. The rationale for developing Triplify is that the largest part of information on the Web is already stored in structured form, often as data contained in relational databases, but usually published by Web applications only as HTML mixing structure, layout and content. In order to reveal the pure structured information behind the current Web, we have implemented Triplify as a light-weight software component, which can be easily integrated into and deployed by the numerous, widely installed Web applications. Our approach includes a method for publishing update logs to enable incremental crawling of linked data sources. Triplify is complemented by a library of configurations for common relational schemata and a REST-enabled data source registry. Triplify configurations containing mappings are provided for many popular Web applications, including osCommerce, WordPress, Drupal, Gallery, and phpBB. We will show that despite its light-weight architecture Triplify is usable to publish very large datasets, such as 160GB of geo data from the OpenStreetMap project.",

        "title": "Discovery of Collocation Patterns: from Visual Words to Visual Phrases",
        "abstract": "A visual word lexicon can be constructed by clustering primitive visual features, and a visual object can be described by a set of visual words. Such a \"bag-of-words\" representation has led to many significant results in various vision tasks including object recognition and categorization. However, in practice, the clustering of primitive visual features tends to result in synonymous visual words that over-represent visual patterns, as well as polysemous visual words that bring large uncertainties and ambiguities in the representation. This paper aims at generating a higher-level lexicon, i.e. visual phrase lexicon, where a visual phrase is a meaningful spatially co-occurrent pattern of visual words. This higher-level lexicon is much less ambiguous than the lower-level one. The contributions of this paper include: (1) a fast and principled solution to the discovery of significant spatial co-occurrent patterns using frequent itemset mining; (2) a pattern summarization method that deals with the compositional uncertainties in visual phrases; and (3) a top-down refinement scheme of the visual word lexicon by feeding back discovered phrases to tune the similarity measure through metric learning.",

Privacy is typically protected by anonymization, i.e., removing names, addresses, etc.We present a framework for analyzing privacy and anonymity in social networks and develop a new re-identification algorithm targeting anonymized social-network graphs. To demonstrate its effectiveness on real-world networks, we show that a third of the users who can be verified to have accounts on both Twitter, a popular microblogging service, and Flickr, an online photo-sharing site, can be re-identified in the anonymous Twitter graph with only a 12% error rate.Our de-anonymization algorithm is based purely on the network topology, does not require creation of a large number of dummy \"sybil\" nodes, is robust to noise and all existing defenses, and works even when the overlap between the target network and the adversary's auxiliary information is small.",

In this paper, we present a generative model based on a deep recurrent architecture that combines recent advances in computer vision and machine translation and that can be used to generate natural sentences describing an image. The model is trained to maximize the likelihood of the target description sentence given the training image. Experiments on several datasets show the accuracy of the model and the fluency of the language it learns solely from image descriptions. Our model is often quite accurate, which we verify both qualitatively and quantitatively. For instance, while the current state-of-the-art BLEU-1 score (the higher the better) on the Pascal dataset is 25, our approach yields 59, to be compared to human performance around 69. We also show BLEU-1 score improvements on Flickr30k, from 56 to 66, and on SBU, from 19 to 28. Lastly, on the newly released COCO dataset, we achieve a BLEU-4 of 27.7, which is the current state-of-the-art.",

        "title": "Collective entity linking in web text: a graph-based method",
        "abstract": "Entity Linking (EL) is the task of linking name mentions in Web text with their referent entities in a knowledge base. Traditional EL methods usually link name mentions in a document by assuming them to be independent. However, there is often additional interdependence between different EL decisions, i.e., the entities in the same document should be semantically related to each other. In these cases, Collective Entity Linking, in which the name mentions in the same document are linked jointly by exploiting the interdependence between them, can improve the entity linking accuracy.   This paper proposes a graph-based collective EL method, which can model and exploit the global interdependence between different EL decisions. Specifically, we first propose a graph-based representation, called Referent Graph, which can model the global interdependence between different EL decisions. Then we propose a collective inference algorithm, which can jointly infer the referent entities of all name mentions by exploiting the interdependence captured in Referent Graph. The key benefit of our method comes from: 1) The global interdependence model of EL decisions; 2) The purely collective nature of the inference algorithm, in which evidence for related EL decisions can be reinforced into high-probability decisions. Experimental results show that our method can achieve significant performance improvement over the traditional EL methods.",

        "abstract": "Easy reuse and integration of declaratively described information in a distributed setting is one of the main motivations for building the Semantic Web. Despite of this claim, reuse and recombination of RDF data today is mostly done using data replication and procedural code. A simple declarative mechanism for reusing and combining RDF data would help users to generate content for the semantic web. Having such a mechanism, the Semantic Web could better benefit from user generated content, as it is broadly present in the so called Web 2.0, but also from better linkage of existing content.   We propose Networked Graphs, which allow users to define RDF graphs both, by extensionally listing content, but also by using views on other graphs. These views can be used to include parts of other graphs, to transform data before including it and to denote rules. The relationships between graphs are described declaratively using SPARQL queries and an extension of the SPARQL semantics. Networked Graphs are easily exchangeable between and interpretable on different computers. Using existing protocols, Networked Graphss can be evaluated in a distributed setting.",

        "abstract": "Traditional machine learning makes a basic assumption: the training and test data should be under the same distribution. However, in many cases, this  identical-distribution  assumption does not hold. The assumption might be violated when a task from one new domain comes, while there are only labeled data from a similar old domain. Labeling the new data can be costly and it would also be a waste to throw away  all  the old data. In this paper, we present a novel transfer learning framework called TrAdaBoost, which extends boosting-based learning algorithms (Freund & Schapire, 1997). TrAdaBoost allows users to utilize a small amount of newly labeled data to leverage the old data to construct a high-quality classification model for the new data. We show that this method can allow us to learn an accurate model using only a tiny amount of new data and a large amount of old data, even when the new data are not sufficient to train a model alone. We show that TrAdaBoost allows knowledge to be effectively transferred from the old data to the new. The effectiveness of our algorithm is analyzed theoretically and empirically to show that our iterative algorithm can converge well to an accurate model.",

        "abstract": "Predicting the occurrence of links is a fundamental problem in networks. In the link prediction problem we are given a snapshot of a network and would like to infer which interactions among existing members are likely to occur in the near future or which existing interactions are we missing. Although this problem has been extensively studied, the challenge of how to effectively combine the information from the network structure with rich node and edge attribute data remains largely open.   We develop an algorithm based on  Supervised Random Walks  that naturally combines the information from the network structure with node and edge level attributes. We achieve this by using these attributes to guide a random walk on the graph. We formulate a supervised learning task where the goal is to learn a function that assigns strengths to edges in the network such that a random walker is more likely to visit the nodes to which new links will be created in the future. We develop an efficient training algorithm to directly learn the edge strength estimation function.   Our experiments on the Facebook social graph and large collaboration networks show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches as well as approaches that are based on feature extraction.",

This paper argues that autonomously \"Semantifying Wikipedia\" is the best way to solve the problem. We choose Wikipedia as an initial data source, because it is comprehensive, not too large, high-quality, and contains enough manually-derived structure to bootstrap an autonomous, self-supervised process. We identify several types of structures which can be automatically enhanced in Wikipedia (e.g., link structure, taxonomic data, infoboxes, etc.), and we describea prototype implementation of a self-supervised, machine learning system which realizes our vision. Preliminary experiments demonstrate the high precision of our system's extracted data - in one case equaling that of humans.",

        "abstract": "Many applications in analytical domains often have the need to \"connect the dots\" i.e., query about the structure of data. In bioinformatics for example, it is typical to want to query  about  interactions between proteins. The aim of such queries is to \"extract\" relationships between entities i.e. paths from a data graph. Often, such queries will specify certain constraints that qualifying results must satisfy e.g. paths involving a set of mandatory nodes. Unfortunately, most present day Semantic Web query languages including the current draft of the anticipated recommendation SPARQL, lack the ability to express queries about arbitrary path structures in data. In addition, many systems that support some limited form of path queries rely on main memory graph algorithms limiting their applicability to very large scale graphs.   In this paper, we present an approach for supporting Path Extraction queries. Our proposal comprises (i) a query language SPARQ2L which extends SPARQL with path variables and path variable constraint expressions, and (ii) a novel query evaluation framework based on efficient algebraic techniques for solving path problems which allows for path queries to be efficiently evaluated on disk resident RDF graphs. The effectiveness of our proposal is demonstrated by a performance evaluation of our approach on both real world based and synthetic dataset.",

        "abstract": "We consider a set of views stating possibly conflicting facts. Negative facts in the views may come, e.g., from functional dependencies in the underlying database schema. We want to predict the truth values of the facts. Beyond simple methods such as voting (typically rather accurate), we explore techniques based on \"corroboration\", i.e., taking into account trust in the views. We introduce three fixpoint algorithms corresponding to different levels of complexity of an underlying probabilistic model. They all estimate both truth values of facts and trust in the views. We present experimental studies on synthetic and real-world data. This analysis illustrates how and in which context these methods improve corroboration results over baseline methods. We believe that corroboration can serve in a wide range of applications such as source selection in the semantic Web, data quality assessment or semantic annotation cleaning in social networks. This work sets the bases for a wide range of techniques for solving these more complex problems.",

        "abstract": "The ability to extract meaningful fragments from an ontology is key for ontology re-use. We propose a definition of a module that guarantees to completely capture the meaning of a given set of terms, i.e., to include all axioms relevant to the meaning of these terms, and study the problem of extracting minimal modules. We show that the problem of determining whether a subset of an ontology is a module for a given vocabulary is undecidable even for rather restricted sub-languages of OWL DL. Hence we propose two \"approximations\", i.e., alternative definitions of modules for a vocabulary that still provide the above guarantee, but that are possibly too strict, and that may thus result in larger modules: the first approximation is semantic and can be computed using existing DL reasoners; the second is syntactic, and can be computed in polynomial time. Finally, we report on an empirical evaluation of our syntactic approximation which demonstrates that the modules we extract are surprisingly small.",

        "abstract": "Various open-source toolkits exist for speech recognition and speech processing. These toolkits have brought a great benefit to the research community, i.e. speeding up research. Yet, no such freely available toolkit exists for automatic affect recognition from speech. We herein introduce a novel open-source affect and emotion recognition engine, which integrates all necessary components in one highly efficient software package. The components include audio recording and audio file reading, state-of-the-art paralinguistic feature extraction and plugable classification modules. In this paper we introduce the engine and extensive baseline results. Pre-trained models for four affect recognition tasks are included in the openEAR distribution. The engine is tailored for multi-threaded, incremental on-line processing of live input in real-time, however it can also be used for batch processing of databases.",

        "abstract": "S4 is a general-purpose, distributed, scalable, partially fault-tolerant, pluggable platform that allows programmers to easily develop applications for processing continuous unbounded streams of data. Keyed data events are routed with affinity to Processing Elements (PEs), which consume the events and do one or both of the following: (1) emit one or more events which may be consumed by other PEs, (2) publish results. The architecture resembles the Actors model, providing semantics of encapsulation and location transparency, thus allowing applications to be massively concurrent while exposing a simple programming interface to application developers. In this paper, we outline the S4 architecture in detail, describe various applications, including real-life deployments. Our design is primarily driven by large scale applications for data mining and machine learning in a production environment. We show that the S4 design is surprisingly flexible and lends itself to run in large clusters built with commodity hardware.",

Our approach leverages datasets of images and their sentence descriptions to learn about the inter-modal correspondences between language and visual data. Our alignment model is based on a novel combination of Convolutional Neural Networks over image regions, bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks over sentences, and a structured objective that aligns the two modalities through a multimodal embedding. We then describe a Multimodal Recurrent Neural Network architecture that uses the inferred alignments to learn to generate novel descriptions of image regions. We demonstrate that our alignment model produces state of the art results in retrieval experiments on Flickr8K, Flickr30K and MSCOCO datasets. We then show that the generated descriptions significantly outperform retrieval baselines on both full images and on a new dataset of region-level annotations.",

        "abstract": "We propose and evaluate a probabilistic framework for estimating a Twitter user's city-level location based purely on the content of the user's tweets, even in the absence of any other geospatial cues. By augmenting the massive human-powered sensing capabilities of Twitter and related microblogging services with content-derived location information, this framework can overcome the sparsity of geo-enabled features in these services and enable new location-based personalized information services, the targeting of regional advertisements, and so on. Three of the key features of the proposed approach are: (i) its reliance purely on tweet content, meaning no need for user IP information, private login information, or external knowledge bases; (ii) a classification component for automatically identifying words in tweets with a strong local geo-scope; and (iii) a lattice-based neighborhood smoothing model for refining a user's location estimate. The system estimates k possible locations for each user in descending order of confidence. On average we find that the location estimates converge quickly (needing just 100s of tweets), placing 51% of Twitter users within 100 miles of their actual location.",

        "title": "Automatically refining the wikipedia infobox ontology",
        "abstract": "The combined efforts of human volunteers have recently extracted numerous facts from Wikipedia, storing them as machine-harvestable object-attribute-value triples in Wikipedia infoboxes. Machine learning systems, such as Kylin, use these infoboxes as training data, accurately extracting even more semantic knowledge from natural language text. But in order to realize the full power of this information, it must be situated in a cleanly-structured ontology. This paper introduces KOG, an autonomous system for refining Wikipedia's infobox-class ontology towards this end. We cast the problem of ontology refinement as a machine learning problem and solve it using both SVMs and a more powerful joint-inference approach expressed in Markov Logic Networks. We present experiments demonstrating the superiority of the joint-inference approach and evaluating other aspects of our system. Using these techniques, we build a rich ontology, integrating Wikipedia's infobox-class schemata with WordNet. We demonstrate how the resulting ontology may be used to enhance Wikipedia with improved query processing and other features.",

        "abstract": "Question-Answer portals such as Naver and Yahoo! Answers are quickly becoming rich sources of knowledge on many topics which are not well served by general web search engines. Unfortunately, the quality of the submitted answers is uneven, ranging from excellent detailed answers to snappy and insulting remarks or even advertisements for commercial content. Furthermore, user feedback for many topics is sparse, and can be insufficient to reliably identify good answers from the bad ones. Hence, estimating the authority of users is a crucial task for this emerging domain, with potential applications to answer ranking, spam detection, and incentive mechanism design. We present an analysis of the link structure of a general-purpose question answering community to discover authoritative users, and promising experimental results over a dataset of more than 3 million answers from a popular community QA site. We also describe structural differences between question topics that correlate with the success of link analysis for authority discovery.",

        "title": "A new approach to cross-modal multimedia retrieval",
        "abstract": "The problem of joint modeling the text and image components of multimedia documents is studied. The text component is represented as a sample from a hidden topic model, learned with latent Dirichlet allocation, and images are represented as bags of visual (SIFT) features. Two hypotheses are investigated: that 1) there is a benefit to explicitly modeling correlations between the two components, and 2) this modeling is more effective in feature spaces with higher levels of abstraction. Correlations between the two components are learned with canonical correlation analysis. Abstraction is achieved by representing text and images at a more general, semantic level. The two hypotheses are studied in the context of the task of cross-modal document retrieval. This includes retrieving the text that most closely matches a query image, or retrieving the images that most closely match a query text. It is shown that accounting for cross-modal correlations and semantic abstraction both improve retrieval accuracy. The cross-modal model is also shown to outperform state-of-the-art image retrieval systems on a unimodal retrieval task.",

In this paper, we present our plan of building the large knowledge collider, a platform for massive distributed incomplete reasoning that will remove these scalability barriers. This is achieved by (i) enriching the current logic-based semantic Web reasoning methods, (ii) employing cognitively inspired approaches and techniques, and (iii) building a distributed reasoning platform and realizing it both on a high-performance computing cluster and via \"computing at home\". In this paper, we will discuss how the technologies of LarKC would move beyond the state-of-the-art of Web scale reasoning.",

        "abstract": "Streams of events appear increasingly today in various Web applications such as blogs, feeds, sensor data streams, geospatial information, on-line financial data, etc. Event Processing (EP) is concerned with timely detection of compound events within streams of simple events. State-of-the-art EP provides on-the-fly analysis of event streams, but cannot combine streams with  background knowledge  and cannot perform  reasoning  tasks. On the other hand, semantic tools can effectively handle background knowledge and perform reasoning thereon, but cannot deal with rapidly changing data provided by event streams.   To bridge the gap, we propose  Event Processing SPARQL (EP-SPARQL)  as a new language for complex events and Stream Reasoning. We provide syntax and formal semantics of the language and devise an effective execution model for the proposed formalism. The execution model is grounded on logic programming, and features effective event processing and inferencing capabilities over temporal and static knowledge. We provide an open-source prototype implementation and present a set of tests to show the usefulness and effectiveness of our approach.",

        "abstract": "Estimating geographic information from an image is an excellent, difficult high-level computer vision problem whose time has come. The emergence of vast amounts of geographically-calibrated image data is a great reason for computer vision to start looking globally - on the scale of the entire planet! In this paper, we propose a simple algorithm for estimating a distribution over geographic locations from a single image using a purely data-driven scene matching approach. For this task, we leverage a dataset of over 6 million GPS-tagged images from the Internet. We represent the estimated image location as a probability distribution over the Earthpsilas surface. We quantitatively evaluate our approach in several geolocation tasks and demonstrate encouraging performance (up to 30 times better than chance). We show that geolocation estimates can provide the basis for numerous other image understanding tasks such as population density estimation, land cover estimation or urban/rural classification.",

These mechanisms have been significantly improved in the latest versions of UML. Unfortunately, there is currently a dearth of published material on how to best exploit these capabilities and, consequently, many UML profiles are either invalid or of poor quality. In this paper, we first provide an overview of the new extensibility mechanisms of UML 2.1 and then describe a method for defining profiles that greatly increases the likelihood of producing technically correct quality UML profiles",

Beginning with a simple word frequency based model (Nenkova and Vanderwende, 2005), we construct a sequence of models each injecting more structure into the representation of document set content and exhibiting ROUGE gains along the way. Our final model, HierSum, utilizes a hierarchical LDA-style model (Blei et al., 2004) to represent content specificity as a hierarchy of topic vocabulary distributions. At the task of producing generic DUC-style summaries, HierSum yields state-of-the-art ROUGE performance and in pairwise user evaluation strongly outperforms Toutanova et al. (2007)'s state-of-the-art discriminative system. We also explore HierSum's capacity to produce multiple 'topical summaries' in order to facilitate content discovery and navigation.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses several key issues in the ArnetMiner system, which aims at extracting and mining academic social networks. Specifically, the system focuses on: 1) Extracting researcher profiles automatically from the Web; 2) Integrating the publication data into the network from existing digital libraries; 3) Modeling the entire academic network; and 4) Providing search services for the academic network. So far, 448,470 researcher profiles have been extracted using a unified tagging approach. We integrate publications from online Web databases and propose a probabilistic framework to deal with the name ambiguity problem. Furthermore, we propose a unified modeling approach to simultaneously model topical aspects of papers, authors, and publication venues. Search services such as expertise search and people association search have been provided based on the modeling results. In this paper, we describe the architecture and main features of the system. We also present the empirical evaluation of the proposed methods.",

        "abstract": "Straightforward classification using kernelized SVMs requires evaluating the kernel for a test vector and each of the support vectors. For a class of kernels we show that one can do this much more efficiently. In particular we show that one can build histogram intersection kernel SVMs (IKSVMs) with runtime complexity of the classifier logarithmic in the number of support vectors as opposed to linear for the standard approach. We further show that by precomputing auxiliary tables we can construct an approximate classifier with constant runtime and space requirements, independent of the number of support vectors, with negligible loss in classification accuracy on various tasks. This approximation also applies to 1 - chi 2  and other kernels of similar form. We also introduce novel features based on a multi-level histograms of oriented edge energy and present experiments on various detection datasets. On the INRIA pedestrian dataset an approximate IKSVM classifier based on these features has the current best performance, with a miss rate 13% lower at 10 -6  False Positive Per Window than the linear SVM detector of Dalal & Triggs. On the Daimler Chrysler pedestrian dataset IKSVM gives comparable accuracy to the best results (based on quadratic SVM), while being 15times faster. In these experiments our approximate IKSVM is up to 2000times faster than a standard implementation and requires 200times less memory. Finally we show that a 50times speedup is possible using approximate IKSVM based on spatial pyramid features on the Caltech 101 dataset with negligible loss of accuracy.",

We investigate an alternative paradigm that does not require labeled corpora, avoiding the domain dependence of ACE-style algorithms, and allowing the use of corpora of any size. Our experiments use Freebase, a large semantic database of several thousand relations, to provide distant supervision. For each pair of entities that appears in some Freebase relation, we find all sentences containing those entities in a large unlabeled corpus and extract textual features to train a relation classifier. Our algorithm combines the advantages of supervised IE (combining 400,000 noisy pattern features in a probabilistic classifier) and unsupervised IE (extracting large numbers of relations from large corpora of any domain). Our model is able to extract 10,000 instances of 102 relations at a precision of 67.6%. We also analyze feature performance, showing that syntactic parse features are particularly helpful for relations that are ambiguous or lexically distant in their expression.",

        "abstract": "The Semantic Web community, until now, has used traditional database systems for the storage and querying of RDF data. The SPARQL query language also closely follows SQL syntax. As a natural consequence, most of the SPARQL query processing techniques are based on database query processing and optimization techniques. For SPARQL join query optimization, previous works like RDF-3X and Hexastore have proposed to use 6-way indexes on the RDF data. Although these indexes speed up merge-joins by orders of magnitude, for complex join queries generating large intermediate join results, the scalability of the query processor still remains a challenge.   In this paper, we introduce (i) BitMat - a compressed bit-matrix structure for storing huge RDF graphs, and (ii) a novel, light-weight SPARQL join query processing method that employs an initial pruning technique, followed by a variable-binding-matching algorithm on BitMats to produce the final results. Our query processing method does not build intermediate join tables and works directly on the compressed data. We have demonstrated our method against RDF graphs of upto 1.33 billion triples - the largest among results published until now (single-node, non-parallel systems), and have compared our method with the state-of-the-art RDF stores - RDF-3X and MonetDB. Our results show that the competing methods are most effective with highly selective queries. On the other hand, BitMat can deliver 2-3 orders of magnitude better performance on complex, low-selectivity queries over massive data.",

        "abstract": "The early Web was hailed for giving individuals the same publishing power as large content providers. But over time, large content providers learned to exploit the structure in their data, leveraging databases and server side technologies to provide rich browsing and visualization. Individual authors fall behind once more: neither old-fashioned static pages nor domain-specific publishing frameworks supporting limited customization can match custom database-backed web applications.   In this paper, we propose Exhibit, a lightweight framework for publishing structured data on standard web servers that requires no installation, database administration, or programming. Exhibit lets authors with relatively limited skills-those same enthusiasts who could write HTML pages for the early Web-publish richly interactive pages that exploit the structure of their data for better browsing and visualization. Such structured publishing in turn makes that data more useful to all of its consumers: individual readers get more powerful interfaces, mashup creators can more easily repurpose the data, and Semantic Web enthusiasts can feed the data to the nascent Semantic Web.",

This paper describes an NLP system which is based on syntactic and semantic formalisms from theoretical linguistics, and which we have used to analyse the entire Gigaword corpus (1 billion words) in less than 5 days using only 18 processors. This combination of detail and speed of analysis represents a break-through in NLP technology.",

        "abstract": "Latent semantic models, such as LSA, intend to map a query to its relevant documents at the semantic level where keyword-based matching often fails. In this study we strive to develop a series of new latent semantic models with a deep structure that project queries and documents into a common low-dimensional space where the relevance of a document given a query is readily computed as the distance between them. The proposed deep structured semantic models are discriminatively trained by maximizing the conditional likelihood of the clicked documents given a query using the clickthrough data. To make our models applicable to large-scale Web search applications, we also use a technique called word hashing, which is shown to effectively scale up our semantic models to handle large vocabularies which are common in such tasks. The new models are evaluated on a Web document ranking task using a real-world data set. Results show that our best model significantly outperforms other latent semantic models, which were considered state-of-the-art in the performance prior to the work presented in this paper.",

In this paper we show how these data can successfully be used to develop a recommender system (RS) that relies exclusively on the information encoded in the Web of Data. We implemented a content-based RS that leverages the data available within Linked Open Data datasets (in particular DBpedia, Freebase and LinkedMDB) in order to recommend movies to the end users. We extensively evaluated the approach and validated the effectiveness of the algorithms by experimentally measuring their accuracy with precision and recall metrics.",

We find that networks in these communities typically differ in their topology from other online networks such as the World Wide Web. Systems targeted to augment web-based communities by automatically identifying users with expertise, for example, need to adapt to the underlying interaction dynamics. In this study, we analyze the Java Forum, a large online help-seeking community, using social network analysis methods. We test a set of network-based ranking algorithms, including PageRank and HITS, on this large size social network in order to identify users with high expertise. We then use simulations to identify a small number of simple simulation rules governing the question-answer dynamic in the network. These simple rules not only replicate the structural characteristics and algorithm performance on the empirically observed Java Forum, but also allow us to evaluate how other algorithms may perform in communities with different characteristics. We believe this approach will be fruitful for practical algorithm design and implementation for online expertise-sharing communities.",

        "abstract": "The lack of publicly available annotated databases is one of the major barriers to research advances on emotional information processing. In this contribution we present a recently collected database of spontaneous emotional speech in German which is being made available to the research community. The database consists of 12 hours of audio-visual recordings of the German TV talk show ldquoVera am Mittagrdquo, segmented into broadcasts, dialogue acts and utterances. This corpus contains spontaneous and very emotional speech recorded from unscripted, authentic discussions between the guests of the talk show. In addition to the audio-visual data and the segmented utterances we provide emotion labels for a great part of the data. The emotion labels are given on a continuous valued scale for three emotion primitives: valence, activation and dominance, using a large number of human evaluators. Such data is of great interest to all research groups working on spontaneous speech analysis, emotion recognition in both speech and facial expression, natural language understanding, and robust speech recognition.",

        "abstract": "Information diffusion and virus propagation are fundamental processes talking place in networks. While it is often possible to directly observe when nodes become infected, observing individual transmissions (i.e., who infects whom or who influences whom) is typically very difficult. Furthermore, in many applications, the underlying network over which the diffusions and propagations spread is actually unobserved. We tackle these challenges by developing a method for tracing paths of diffusion and influence through networks and inferring the networks over which contagions propagate. Given the times when nodes adopt pieces of information or become infected, we identify the optimal network that best explains the observed infection times. Since the optimization problem is NP-hard to solve exactly, we develop an efficient approximation algorithm that scales to large datasets and in practice gives provably near-optimal performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by tracing information cascades in a set of 170 million blogs and news articles over a one year period to infer how information flows through the online media space. We find that the diffusion network of news tends to have a core-periphery structure with a small set of core media sites that diffuse information to the rest of the Web. These sites tend to have stable circles of influence with more general news media sites acting as connectors between them.",

        "title": "Evaluating similarity measures for emergent semantics of social tagging",
        "abstract": "Social bookmarking systems are becoming increasingly important data sources for bootstrapping and maintaining Semantic Web applications. Their emergent information structures have become known as folksonomies. A key question for harvesting semantics from these systems is how to extend and adapt traditional notions of similarity to folksonomies, and which measures are best suited for applications such as community detection, navigation support, semantic search, user profiling and ontology learning. Here we build an evaluation framework to compare various general folksonomy-based similarity measures, which are derived from several established information-theoretic, statistical, and practical measures. Our framework deals generally and symmetrically with users, tags, and resources. For evaluation purposes we focus on similarity between tags and between resources and consider different methods to aggregate annotations across users. After comparing the ability of several tag similarity measures to predict user-created tag relations, we provide an external grounding by user-validated semantic proxies based on WordNet and the Open Directory Project. We also investigate the issue of scalability. We find that mutual information with distributional micro-aggregation across users yields the highest accuracy, but is not scalable; per-user projection with collaborative aggregation provides the best scalable approach via incremental computations. The results are consistent across resource and tag similarity.",

        "abstract": "Online content exhibits rich temporal dynamics, and diverse realtime user generated content further intensifies this process. However, temporal patterns by which online content grows and fades over time, and by which different pieces of content compete for attention remain largely unexplored.   We study temporal patterns associated with online content and how the content's popularity grows and fades over time. The attention that content receives on the Web varies depending on many factors and occurs on very different time scales and at different resolutions. In order to uncover the temporal dynamics of online content we formulate a time series clustering problem using a similarity metric that is invariant to scaling and shifting. We develop the K-Spectral Centroid ( K-SC ) clustering algorithm that effectively finds cluster centroids with our similarity measure. By applying an adaptive wavelet-based incremental approach to clustering, we scale  K-SC  to large data sets.   We demonstrate our approach on two massive datasets: a set of 580 million Tweets, and a set of 170 million blog posts and news media articles. We find that  K-SC  outperforms the K-means clustering algorithm in finding distinct shapes of time series. Our analysis shows that there are six main temporal shapes of attention of online content. We also present a simple model that reliably predicts the shape of attention by using information about only a small number of participants. Our analyses offer insight into common temporal patterns of the content on theWeb and broaden the understanding of the dynamics of human attention.",

The Datalog+/- family admits existentially quantified variables in rule heads, and has suitable restrictions to ensure highly efficient ontology querying. We show in particular that Datalog+/- generalizes the DL-Lite family of tractable description logics, which are the most common tractable ontology languages in the context of the Semantic Web and databases. We also show how stratified negation can be added to Datalog+/- while keeping ontology querying tractable. Furthermore, the Datalog+/- family is of interest in its own right and can, moreover, be used in various contexts such as data integration and data exchange.",

In this paper, we focus on customer reviews of products. In particular, we study the problem of determining the semantic orientations (positive, negative or neutral) of opinions expressed on product features in reviews. This problem has many applications, e.g., opinion mining, summarization and search. Most existing techniques utilize a list of  opinion (bearing) words  (also called  opinion  lexicon) for the purpose. Opinion words are words that express desirable (e.g., great, amazing, etc.) or undesirable (e.g., bad, poor, etc) states. These approaches, however, all have some major shortcomings. In this paper, we propose a  holistic lexicon-based approach  to solving the problem by exploiting external evidences and linguistic conventions of natural language expressions. This approach allows the system to handle opinion words that are context dependent, which cause major difficulties for existing algorithms. It also deals with many special words, phrases and language constructs which have impacts on opinions based on their linguistic patterns. It also has an effective function for aggregating multiple conflicting opinion words in a sentence. A system, called Opinion Observer, based on the proposed technique has been implemented. Experimental results using a benchmark product review data set and some additional reviews show that the proposed technique is highly effective. It outperforms existing methods significantly",

        "abstract": "The size of data sets being collected and analyzed in the industry for business intelligence is growing rapidly, making traditional warehousing solutions prohibitively expensive. Hadoop [1] is a popular open-source map-reduce implementation which is being used in companies like Yahoo, Facebook etc. to store and process extremely large data sets on commodity hardware. However, the map-reduce programming model is very low level and requires developers to write custom programs which are hard to maintain and reuse. In this paper, we present Hive, an open-source data warehousing solution built on top of Hadoop. Hive supports queries expressed in a SQL-like declarative language - HiveQL, which are compiled into map-reduce jobs that are executed using Hadoop. In addition, HiveQL enables users to plug in custom map-reduce scripts into queries. The language includes a type system with support for tables containing primitive types, collections like arrays and maps, and nested compositions of the same. The underlying IO libraries can be extended to query data in custom formats. Hive also includes a system catalog - Metastore - that contains schemas and statistics, which are useful in data exploration, query optimization and query compilation. In Facebook, the Hive warehouse contains tens of thousands of tables and stores over 700TB of data and is being used extensively for both reporting and ad-hoc analyses by more than 200 users per month.",

        "abstract": "Customer preferences for products are drifting over time. Product perception and popularity are constantly changing as new selection emerges. Similarly, customer inclinations are evolving, leading them to ever redefine their taste. Thus, modeling temporal dynamics should be a key when designing recommender systems or general customer preference models. However, this raises unique challenges. Within the eco-system intersecting multiple products and customers, many different characteristics are shifting simultaneously, while many of them influence each other and often those shifts are delicate and associated with a few data instances. This distinguishes the problem from concept drift explorations, where mostly a single concept is tracked. Classical time-window or instance-decay approaches cannot work, as they lose too much signal when discarding data instances. A more sensitive approach is required, which can make better distinctions between transient effects and long term patterns. The paradigm we offer is creating a model tracking the time changing behavior throughout the life span of the data. This allows us to exploit the relevant components of all data instances, while discarding only what is modeled as being irrelevant. Accordingly, we revamp two leading collaborative filtering recommendation approaches. Evaluation is made on a large movie rating dataset by Netflix. Results are encouraging and better than those previously reported on this dataset.",

        "abstract": "Low-rank matrix approximation methods provide one of the simplest and most effective approaches to collaborative filtering. Such models are usually fitted to data by finding a MAP estimate of the model parameters, a procedure that can be performed efficiently even on very large datasets. However, unless the regularization parameters are tuned carefully, this approach is prone to overfitting because it finds a single point estimate of the parameters. In this paper we present a fully Bayesian treatment of the Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF) model in which model capacity is controlled automatically by integrating over all model parameters and hyperparameters. We show that Bayesian PMF models can be efficiently trained using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods by applying them to the Netflix dataset, which consists of over 100 million movie ratings. The resulting models achieve significantly higher prediction accuracy than PMF models trained using MAP estimation.",

Spoofax integrates language processing techniques for parser generation, meta-programming, and IDE development into a single environment. It uses concise, declarative specifications for languages and IDE services. In this paper we describe the architecture of Spoofax and introduce idioms for high-level specifications of language semantics using rewrite rules, showing how analyses can be reused for transformations, code generation, and editor services such as error marking, reference resolving, and content completion. The implementation of these services is supported by language-parametric editor service classes that can be dynamically loaded by the Eclipse IDE, allowing new languages to be developed and used side-by-side in the same Eclipse environment.",

        "abstract": "A common perception is that there are two competing visions for the future evolution of the Web: the Semantic Web and Web 2.0. A closer look, though, reveals that the core technologies and concerns of these two approaches are complementary and that each field can and must draw from the other's strengths. We believe that future web applications will retain the Web 2.0 focus on community and usability, while drawing on Semantic Web infrastructure to facilitate mashup-like information sharing. However, there are several open issues that must be addressed before such applications can become commonplace. In this paper, we outline a semantic weblogs scenario that illustrates the potential for combining Web 2.0 and Semantic Web technologies, while highlighting the unresolved issues that impede its realization. Nevertheless, we believe that the scenario can be realized in the short-term. We point to recent progress made in resolving each of the issues as well as future research directions for each of the communities.",

        "title": "Exploiting Wikipedia as external knowledge for document clustering",
        "abstract": "In traditional text clustering methods, documents are represented as \"bags of words\" without considering the semantic information of each document. For instance, if two documents use different collections of core words to represent the same topic, they may be falsely assigned to different clusters due to the lack of shared core words, although the core words they use are probably synonyms or semantically associated in other forms. The most common way to solve this problem is to enrich document representation with the background knowledge in an ontology. There are two major issues for this approach: (1) the coverage of the ontology is limited, even for WordNet or Mesh, (2) using ontology terms as replacement or additional features may cause information loss, or introduce noise. In this paper, we present a novel text clustering method to address these two issues by enriching document representation with Wikipedia concept and category information. We develop two approaches, exact match and relatedness-match, to map text documents to Wikipedia concepts, and further to Wikipedia categories. Then the text documents are clustered based on a similarity metric which combines document content information, concept information as well as category information. The experimental results using the proposed clustering framework on three datasets (20-newsgroup, TDT2, and LA Times) show that clustering performance improves significantly by enriching document representation with Wikipedia concepts and categories.",

Here we propose a formal model of one specific semantic search task: ad-hoc object retrieval. We show that this task provides a solid framework to study some of the semantic search problems currently tackled by commercial Web search engines. We connect this task to the traditional ad-hoc document retrieval and discuss appropriate evaluation metrics. Finally, we carry out a realistic evaluation of this task in the context of a Web search application.",

        "abstract": "Continuous SPARQL (C-SPARQL) is proposed as new language for continuous queries over streams of RDF data. It covers a gap in the Semantic Web abstractions which is needed for many emerging applications, including our focus on Urban Computing. In this domain, sensor-based information on roads must be processed to deduce localized traffic conditions and then produce traffic management strategies. Executing C-SPARQL queries requires the effective integration of SPARQL and streaming technologies, which capitalize over a decade of research and development; such integration poses several nontrivial challenges.   In this paper we (a) show the syntax and semantics of the C-SPARQL language together with some examples; (b) introduce a query graph model which is an intermediate representation of queries devoted to optimization; (c) discuss the features of an execution environment that leverages existing technologies; (d) introduce optimizations in terms of rewriting rules applied to the query graph model, so as to efficiently exploit the execution environment; and (e) show evidence of the effectiveness of our optimizations on a prototype of execution environment.",
